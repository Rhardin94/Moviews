# Unit 16 - Project Suggestions

### Overview

Since projects are being worked on this unit, you won't have a homework assignment, but a project is a perfect context in which to practice writing tests! 

Incorporate a few of the below suggestions into your project. You'll write better code, and it will help you consolidate your testing habits.

### Testing Suggestions

* Set up Karma so you can run your tests as you develop.

* Prior to implementing a feature, use Nightmare to write a functional test for it.

* Prior to implementing a function, use Mocha and Chai to write unit tests against it.

* Run your tests prior to committing your code so you can be sure nothing breaks between commits.

* **Non-Obligatory Bonus**: If you're confident and feel like you have some time to tinker, set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). This will automatically run your tests whenever you or any of your team members makes a commit.
